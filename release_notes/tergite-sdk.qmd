### Added

- Added caching of calibration requests to reduce number of calls to remote API
- Added caching on Job's `status()`, `result()`, `download_url` to reduce number of calls to remote API
- Added sending of `calibration_date` (str) query parameter during job registration.
- Added end-to-end tests for `qiskit_pulse_1q` simulator backend
- Added end-to-end tests for `qiskit_pulse_2q` simulator backend
- Added Gitlab and Github CI configurations for end-to-end tests

## [2024.12.1]
_released on: 18th of December 2024_

### Changed

- Updated tests to run tests against multiple backends
- Updated `Provider.job()` to return a `Job` instance without an upload_url

## [2024.12.0]
_released on: 11th of December 2024_

### Added
